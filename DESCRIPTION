Description: Computes the t* statistic corresponding to the tau star population
    coefficient introduced by Bergsma and Dassios (Bernoulli 20(2), 2014,
    1006-1028) and does so in  O(n^2*log(n)) time. Can provide both the
    V-statistic and U-statistic related to the tau star measure depending on
    user preference.
