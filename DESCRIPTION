Description: Computes the t* statistic corresponding to the tau* population
          coefficient introduced by Bergsma and Dassios (2014) <DOI:10.3150/13-BEJ514>
          and does so in O(n^2*log(n)) time following the algorithm of Weihs,
          Drton, and Leung (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s00180-015-0639-x>. Also allows for
          independence testing using the asymptotic distribution of t* as described by
          Nandy, Weihs, and Drton (2016) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04387>.
