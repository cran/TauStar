# TauStar 1.1.3

## Features
* The tStar function now computes the statistic more efficiently using the algorithm described by Heller and Heller (2016). The old algorithm can still be accessed using optional parameters to the function.

## Bugfix
* C++ code has been updated so it doesn't cause errors on certain compilers.
* Printing of the output of the tauStarTest function has been fixed.
